This Python project implements extractive text summarization using an algorithm inspired by Google's PageRank. In the context of text summarization, "extractive" means that the summary is generated by selecting and rearranging existing sentences from the original text, as opposed to "abstractive" summarization, where the summary may contain rephrased or newly generated sentences.

#Extractive Summarization
In extractive summarization, the goal is to identify the most informative sentences from a given text and present them as a coherent summary. This project achieves extractive summarization by adopting an algorithm reminiscent of Google's PageRank, which is widely known for ranking web pages in search engine results.

#How It Works
Preprocessing: The text data is preprocessed, including tasks like tokenization and removing stopwords.

Feature Extraction: A TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation is created for each sentence in the text. This representation captures the importance of each word within a sentence and the document as a whole.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is calculated between these TF-IDF vectors. It measures the similarity between sentences and serves as a way to assess how related different sentences are to each other.

Similarity Matrix: A similarity matrix is constructed based on the cosine similarity values. This matrix represents the relationships between sentences.

Ranking Sentences: The algorithm applies a ranking mechanism to the sentences within the text. Sentences with higher rankings are considered more important.

Final Summary: The highest-ranked sentences are selected to form the final summary. The number of sentences selected depends on a factor value, which you can adjust.

#Inspired by Google PageRank
This project takes inspiration from the PageRank algorithm that Google uses to rank web pages. In PageRank, web pages are treated as nodes in a network, and the algorithm assigns importance scores to these pages based on the links between them. In a similar fashion, this project views sentences as nodes in a network of information. Sentences that are more "linked" to other important sentences are ranked higher and are included in the extractive summary.

By using an algorithm akin to PageRank, this project leverages the same concept of identifying important elements within a network, but instead of web pages, it focuses on sentences within text documents.
